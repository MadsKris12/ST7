Bullet points: 

\begin{itemize}
\item results, compare them to regression
\item accuracy, sensitivity and specificity
\item Pain duration vs pain intensity
\item Split body approach
\item data amount (not large enough)
\end{itemize}

number of pain maps and split body and Linear correlation, threshold
--> splitbody assumption according duration, intensity, independent)
--> threshold, losing pain maps 
Classification according to output
Classification of pain maps
optimization of the model --> gridsearch, computerpower, input parameters (subjects activity level, age, other pain (hip pain ect.))
