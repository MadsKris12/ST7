This study predicted pain maps according to the pain duration or pain intensity.
The CR performed with the highest accuracy according to pain intensity, despite the subjectivity of pain and the influence of multidimensional factors.
There may be an indication of patterns to be found between pain maps and pain duration or pain intensity, however further optimization, more pain maps or additional studies are needed to support whether location and morphology contain positive predictive value in terms of predicting pain duration or pain intensity.
