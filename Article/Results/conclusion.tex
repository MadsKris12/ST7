During this study the deep learning models were presented for classifying pain maps according to the pain duration and pain intensity.
The overall performance of the models were calculated, to which the combined-representation performed the highest accuracy, but the models using the morphology-representation resulted as the most robust classifier. 
There may be an indication of a pattern to be found between pain maps and pain duration or pain intensity, however further optimization or additional studies is needed to support whether location or morphology contains positive predictive value in terms of classifying pain duration or pain intensity.
