During this study the deep learning models were presented for classifying pain maps according to the pain duration or pain intensity.
The overall performance of the models were calculated, to which the CR performed with the highest accuracy, but the models using the MR resulted as the most reliable classifier based on the sensitivity and specificity. 
There may be an indication of a pattern to be found between pain maps and pain duration or pain intensity, however further optimization or additional studies is needed to support whether location or morphology contains positive predictive value in terms of classifying pain duration or pain intensity.
