This study predicted pain maps according to the pain duration or pain intensity.
The model using the pain map representation reflecting both morphology and location of pain resulted in the highest accuracy according to pain intensity, despite the subjectivity of pain and the influence of multidimensional factors. The representation only including the location could not find patterns in the pain maps, to which this representation is not recommended. 
There may be an indication of patterns to be found between pain maps and pain duration or pain intensity, however further optimization, more pain maps or additional studies are needed to support whether location and morphology contain positive predictive value in terms of predicting pain duration or pain intensity.
