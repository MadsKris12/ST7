\section{Machine learning}
Machine learning describes the use of algorithms to make a system able to identify different data types, like images or text, for transcription of speech into text, matching news items, posts or selection of relevant results of search \citep{LeCun2015}.
Machine learning identifies rules in a dataset from given input and output. If a computer learns this feature, it can be used to make intelligent decisions and predict specific outcomes.\citep{Nielsen2010}
Machine learning is a field that has seen a lot of progress over the past decades, partially because developers recognize the ease in training a system only using examples of the desired in- and output behavior. By using this method it is easier than trying to manually write a piece of code that anticipates different scenarios from different input types.\citep{Jordan2015}
