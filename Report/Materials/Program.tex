\subsection{Python}
In this project it is chosen to use Python v3.6.3 for development of the neural network.  
Python is an object-oriented and general-purpose programming and scripting language. Python is among other things used for programming websites, mobile applications, desktop GUI's, but also used for Machine Learning programming, which has been on the rise over the past few years.    
When developing a machine learning application, there are different libraries that can be used, where some of the most popular is the Theano and the TensoFlow libraries.\citep{Swamynathan2017}

In this project the TensorFlow v1.3.0 library has been used. 
TensorFlow is an open source library for development of machine learning applications, the has been released by Google \citep{Swamynathan2017}. 


\textbf{maybe something about keras... if we are gonna use it.  }
Keras is a high-level neural network library, that runs on top of either TensorFlow or Theano. Keras is a simplified version of the two libraries, which makes easier to program in Python, but still allows for building complex models.\citep{Swamynathan2017}
